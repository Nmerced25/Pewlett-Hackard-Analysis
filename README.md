# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview and Analysis
  The purpose of this project is to utilize the skills learned in the SQL mod in conjunction with the PGAdmin in order to process data and create tables
  to help illustrate a given data set. This assignment tests our ability to use the features of SQL in a way to give the reader a better breakdown of the
  multiple datasets.
  
# Results
  # Deliverable 1
  
    Within the first deliverable, a table was created and filtered in order to find the appropriate amount of elidgeable employees that are ready to retire.
  This was achived by creating a "Mod_challenge_Table" with the code that was used below:

  The above image illustrates the data that was initally filtered before removing the duplicates as well as the employees that are no longer with the company. 
  the below image shows the code that was used in order to achive the next step:

  After looking at data, I had ran into issues creating the sset that would show the number of retires by job title. This along with many issues during the lesson mod 
  itself have not allowed me to move onto the step where I would be able to pull such data. Unfortunately, the conclusions that I can make from this are that there are:
  
  -Over 50,000 positions that are opening up
  -The amount of employees that are retiring can cause more damage to the company due to the amount of people that are leaving.
  # Deliverable 2
    With reguards to the second deliverable, a table would be createrd in order to show employees tgatr were born in a specific period of time by using this code below:

  -When it came to setting up this code, I again ran into errors that prevented me from moving forward with it. I had tried to troubleshoot the issues with no avail due
  to a syntax error that continued to show when I would run the code. 
  -This was a similar event that I had ran into in terms of an error within the lesson mod itself when following the steps in the lesson where I would hit a syntax 
  error on a premade code. 
  
 # Summary
  1.) When it comes to the amount of roles that would need to be filled as employees retire, it seems to be set within the 10s of thousands of employees that would 
  need to be hired. This would be illustrated by the codes that were provided above to help show the impact that it would make on the company.
  2.) When it comes to the mentorship, I am unable to provide an answer to this question due to the errors that I came across when setting up the codes.
